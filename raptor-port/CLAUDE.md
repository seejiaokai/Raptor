# RAPTOR — 142 SQN Flying Programme (React app)

A flying-schedule planner for an F-15SG squadron: a week of flying waves,
duty crews, sims, ground events and personal inputs, with a validation
engine that flags crew-rest breaches, double bookings, missing briefs and
qualification problems, plus an amendment (AL) workflow for publishing
changes after a day is signed off. No server — per-browser localStorage.

This file is the INDEX. It holds the rules that apply to every task and
routes to where the detail lives; don't duplicate that detail back here.

## How to work here

**Reach 95% confidence before building.** If the request could reasonably
mean two different things, or a choice would materially change the result,
ask follow-up questions until it wouldn't. Small, unambiguous asks clear
that bar on their own — don't manufacture questions for them.

**Match the process to the risk — the owner chose MEDIUM as the default
(owner, 7 Aug 26), after the stores-configuration feature took a full day
under the heaviest one.** Medium is: understand the ask, build it, have one
reviewer check the finished work, report. No separate spec document, no
task-by-task plan, no per-step sign-off. Drop to LIGHT — just build it and
run the gates — for cosmetic work, copy, a new column, a filter. Escalate
to HEAVY (spec → plan → task-by-task with a review and fix loop on each)
only where a defect would be SILENT rather than obvious: persisted data,
roles and permissions, the validation engine, anything the byte-exact
reference parity or the perf ceilings sit on top of. Say at the time that
you are escalating, and why. And prefer BATCHES — most of the cost is
loading this app into context, so five related changes in one pass cost
barely more than one.

- **The owner is non-technical.** Explanations to him are plain-language
  and complete; terseness applies to tool use and internal work, never to
  what he reads. **He does not want technical/implementation decisions put
  to him either (owner, 7 Aug 26)** — make that call yourself and tell him
  what you decided and why, in plain terms; this is distinct from the
  product-direction options §Product bar & ideation still asks for, which
  stay owner choices. **He restated the plain-language rule on 6 Aug 26
  because it was being ignored**, so it is spelled out rather than left to
  judgment:
  - **Never paste raw output at him** — no log lines, stack traces, JSON,
    run IDs, commit hashes, HTTP codes, file:line references or CSS class
    names. Read the thing yourself and report what it MEANS. "The publish
    step gave up after ten minutes" — not `##[error]Timeout reached`.
  - **Lead with what it means for him**, then the detail if it earns its
    place. He wants to know: is it working, is it live, what do I do now.
  - **Name things the way the app does.** "The ring around the puck", "the
    warning list", "the previous day" — not `.boxdash`, `dayWarnHTML`,
    `WARN.trace[prevDi]`. Internal names belong in code comments and
    commit messages, which are written for the next agent, not for him.
  - **Say what you did and whether it worked.** A gate table with counts is
    fine — it is a result, not jargon. A diff walkthrough is not.
  - This is about VOCABULARY, not depth. Do not thin out the reasoning, the
    trade-offs or the caveats; say them in ordinary words. Never hide a
    limitation because explaining it would take a sentence more.
- **Ship it.** Once the gates are green, open a PR to `main` and merge so
  it deploys — don't wait to be asked (unless a gate is red or the change
  was called an experiment).
- **Delegate frugally, by judgment.** The main session plans, reviews
  diffs and runs the gates first-hand. Scanning/exploration goes to
  Explore on **haiku**; multi-file or mechanical code-writing goes to
  general-purpose on **sonnet**, handed a precise spec (files, expected
  shape, which tests to run) so it never explores. Agents return diffs
  and conclusions, never file dumps. Small precise work stays inline —
  spawning an agent costs more than a one-file fix.
- **Token discipline.** Never let a tool dump raw output — pipe logs
  through `tail`/`grep`, ask GitHub MCP tools for `minimal_output: true`,
  paginate 5–10, and prefer a 2-line `curl | grep` over a full API object
  when checking one field. Never read `reference/` whole (6.6k lines) —
  `grep` it; same for any file over ~300 lines (Grep or offset/limit Reads).
  While iterating run only the affected test file
  (`npx vitest run <file>`); the full four gates once, before the PR.
  Trust this index instead of re-exploring. Prefer a fresh
  session per task; a long conversation re-sends itself every turn.

## Product bar & ideation (owner, 7 Aug 26)

Distilled from the owner's product-standards brief; this section IS the
standard — the full brief is deliberately not kept. Autonomy is unchanged:
the confidence rule above still decides when to ask, and green gates still
ship without waiting to be asked.

- **Ideate before building non-trivial UX.** Restate the problem BEHIND the
  literal ask, then offer 2–3 directions — the conventional one, a more
  ambitious one where it genuinely serves the user, a leaner one where it
  exists — each with a one-line case and rough effort, plus a
  recommendation, and let the owner pick. Small unambiguous asks skip
  straight to building. (The 7 Aug blue-selection build-and-rollback is the
  standing example: the ideation question is cheaper than the build.)
  **When a direction is visual, show a PICTURE before product code (owner,
  7 Aug 26):** a throwaway HTML comp in the app's own stylesheet,
  screenshotted at phone and desktop widths — pixel-faithful because it IS
  the real palette — so the owner approves what it looks like, not a
  description of it.
- **Challenge a risky ask in a sentence or two**: the underlying user
  problem, any unnecessary complexity, a simpler alternative, a wrong
  assumption — then build what the owner decides, without relitigating.
- **The bar is production, not prototype.** Clear hierarchy and primary
  actions; spacing, type and colour consistent with scheduler.css's
  measured contracts; responsive at phone and desktop (both gated in e2e);
  accessible — labels, contrast, keyboard reach; real empty, loading, error
  and confirmation states on every new surface. No placeholder behaviour
  presented as working.
- **Scope is the ask.** Improvements noticed en route are REPORTED as
  options, never built unasked. A rejected or rolled-back idea is recorded
  in §Stable decisions and never reintroduced silently.
- **Verified vs assumed, always distinguished.** "Checked" means read or
  run first-hand this session; anything else is stated as an assumption.

**Scoping any new work weighs four axes** (owner, 7 Aug 26), each grounded
in what this repo actually has rather than a generic checklist:

- **Performance & scalability.** The perf gate is the law: per-node budgets
  and DOM ceilings in `probes/perf-port.cjs`, re-measured, never quoted. A
  feature that grows the DOM raises its ceiling as a deliberate, argued
  edit in the same PR. Dense surfaces stay string-built (§Architecture).
  True scaling — shared data, real accounts — is server work (HANDOFF's
  first bullet); until then every write goes through the mutation funnel
  and storage through `HOOKS.storeBackend`, which is precisely what keeps
  that migration possible. Do not add state outside those two paths.
- **User experience.** The bar above, plus the standing proof: the
  live-view pass in §Build & verify IS the UX check — drive the built
  bundle, screenshot, and look, before calling anything done.
- **Security.** No secrets, tokens or credentials in the repo or its
  history — the deploy needs none. Every user-entered string is escaped at
  the builder (two unescaped sinks were found 6 Aug; assume more is
  possible). Role checks live at the PAGE and the write path, not the nav
  (`canEditSched`, `resetSession` — the 6 Aug lesson). And never present
  the prototype auth as security: the site is public, accounts are
  hard-coded, and anything genuinely sensitive stays out of the demo data.
- **Future development & DevOps.** Ship through the gated pipeline only —
  four gates in CI on every PR and push, plus the two local-only gates for
  UI work; nothing deploys red. Write for the next session: comments say
  WHY, `HANDOFF.md` stays true in the same PR, decisions that must not be
  relitigated go to §Stable decisions, and the deploy traps (OIDC re-runs,
  the ten-minute Pages ceiling, dispatch-cancels-push) are documented in
  HANDOFF before they are ever debugged twice.

## Build & verify

Run from `raptor-port/`, not the repo root. All four, after any change:

```
npm test                    # Vitest — must stay green
npm run build               # typecheck + build
node reference/tfin.js      # the original's assertions — must stay 728/0
npm run test:e2e            # geometry in a real browser — builds & serves itself
```

`test:e2e` is the fourth gate because jsdom has no layout engine: a puck that
had silently grown to 90px passes `npm test` all day. It runs in CI too.

**Stand up the live view for any UI-visible task, every session** (owner ask,
6 Aug 26 — a standing instruction, not a per-task one). Build, serve, and
drive the real thing in a real browser BEFORE saying it works:

```
npm run build && npx vite preview --port 4173     # the production bundle
```

then a short Playwright script (`executablePath` rule below) to log in,
navigate, **screenshot the element in question and LOOK at it**, read
computed style, and watch for console errors, 4xx responses and page errors.
`vite.config.ts` sets `base:'./'`, so this preview is the deployed page in
every respect except the hostname — a local check is not a proxy for the real
thing, it IS the real bundle.

The reason is not diligence for its own sake. A crew-rest ring shipped drawn
as a fat solid box while 604 vitest tests passed, because jsdom loads no
stylesheet and reports every rect as 0×0: it could prove which CLASS was
emitted and nothing about what was painted. The same pass caught a 404 on
every page load, and caught a first favicon that was invisible at 16px. None
of those are reachable from `npm test`.

UI-visible work also needs the wider browser path:
`probes/run.cjs <name> port`, `npm run probes:adapted` (the six adapted
probes), `npm run perf` (the reference-vs-port no-regression gate) — all
against that same preview.
A fresh container needs `npm ci` first — `node_modules/` is not in the image.
Any NEW Playwright script must pass `executablePath:'/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`
(a stable symlink): the pinned Playwright looks for a browser build the image
doesn't ship, so a bare `chromium.launch()` dies with "Executable doesn't
exist … run npx playwright install" — do NOT run that, it re-downloads for
nothing. Every probe in `reference/probes/` already hardcodes the path.
Login is `a`/`a` (admin) or `user`/`user` (squadron member — NOT view-only
since 5 Aug 26: a member edits their own Inputs and ticks their own quals;
the split is in `docs/engine-rules.md` §Auth / roles). The username is
lowercased before matching, the PASSWORD is compared exactly, so `A`/`A` is
rejected.
**The deployed site is reachable now, and checking work against it is a
standing instruction (owner, 7 Aug 26).** The proxy used to answer 403 for
`github.io`; the owner opened it, and both the page and `githubstatus.com`
were driven end to end from the container on 7 Aug. **After every change that
ships, load the real page and look at it** — do not report a change as live
on the strength of a green workflow.

The two checks answer different questions and neither replaces the other: the
`vite preview` above is the bundle BEFORE it ships, and it is what you iterate
against; the deployed page is what the squadron actually gets, and it is the
only thing that can show a fault introduced between the build and the browser
— a stale CDN cache, a base path wrong as served, an asset that 404s only
under the `/Raptor/` sub-path. Sequence is: preview while building, gates,
merge, then the live page once Pages has rolled over.

Reachability, and the reason if it ever closes again:

```
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://seejiaokai.github.io/Raptor/
curl -sS "$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status"      # logs each rejected host
```

`000` means blocked again — report the blocked host, never route around it,
and fall back to the preview plus the workflow's job conclusions.

**Driving it needs three launch settings Chromium does not take from the
environment** (7 Aug 26 — a bare `chromium.launch()` fails with
`ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`, which reads like the site is down and is not):

```js
chromium.launch({
  executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium',
  chromiumSandbox: false,                              // sandbox + proxy = instant exit
  proxy: { server: process.env.HTTPS_PROXY },          // NOT inherited from the env var
  args: ['--ssl-version-max=tls1.2'],                  // TLS 1.3 handshakes get reset
})
```

Those three are the whole recipe — `ignoreHTTPSErrors` is NOT needed despite
the proxy re-signing TLS (measured both ways, 7 Aug 26: the CA is already in
Chromium's NSS store). Do not add it reflexively; it would mask a genuine
certificate fault later.
The reset is worth recognising on sight: it is silent at the proxy (only
Chromium's own telemetry shows up in the failure log), it hits every host and
not just this one, and it is TLS, not policy — a 403 is policy, a reset is
this. Login is `#luser` / `#lpass` / `#loginForm button[type=submit]`, same
as `e2e/app.ts`, and `#vWeek .day` is the "week is up" signal. Watch console
errors, page errors and 4xx responses on the way through; screenshot the
element in question and LOOK at it.

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` reruns the gates and
publishes to **https://seejiaokai.github.io/Raptor/**. Nothing deploys red.

## Architecture rules (apply to nearly every task)

**The store.** `notify()` bumps a version; components subscribe via
`useVersion()` (useSyncExternalStore) and re-read the singletons.
`state/view.ts` holds UI state the engine reads (CURPAGE, SBDAY, ARM,
selection, EDITON) as module `let`s with same-module setters — ESM can't
reassign across modules. `WARN`/`REST`/`EVD` are reassigned by every
`validate()`: always re-read, never cache.

**The slot-key grammar** — everything addresses through this, and the day
index is always first after the prefix (`keyDay()` depends on it):

- Flying seat `di.gi.li.ai.seat` (no prefix) — day, wave, formation,
  aircraft, seat `p` (FCP) or `w` (RCP).
- Duty `d:di.dwi.ri` · Sim `s:di.kind.ri` · Ground `g:di.ri` ·
  Programme `a:di.ri` · `.+` appends · `.xN` is overflow `row.more[N]`.
- Text keys: `dn:` day note · scheduler notes `pn:` programme, `dtn:` duties,
  `sn:` sims, `gn:` ground · `ap:` programme · `wl:`
  wave label · `ff:` formation · `fr:` flight remarks · `it:` in-times ·
  `dl:/dr:` duty · `sr:` sim · `gr:` ground · `st:` stores ·
  `ar:/at:` area/area-time · `tr:` traffic.

**The mutation funnel — bypassing it is always a bug.** All schedule
writes go through `slotVal`/`setSlotVal`/`fillSlot`/`txtGet`/`txtSet` →
`noteChange(key)` → `afterSchedMutate()`. A write that skips it is
invisible to the amendment machinery: not marked pending, absent from the
next AL, never re-validated. Deletes call `markEdit()` with **no key** — a
delete must not re-mark the address it just removed.

**React owns chrome, strings own density.** The dense surfaces (week,
board, palette) are built by verbatim HTML-string builders and swapped via
innerHTML with string-diffing — that is what preserves scroll, carets and
the phone perf budget. Don't convert them to components.

## Coding conventions

- **`src/engine/` bodies are verbatim ports.** Compressed one-line style,
  semicolons, `:any` annotations — leave it alone. A diff there should be
  the behaviour change and nothing else; no tidying, no reformatting.
- **`src/ui/` and `src/state/` are ordinary TS/React**: 2-space indent, no
  semicolons, single quotes.
- **Comments explain WHY**, in prose, above the code — often the bug they
  fix. That density is the house style; match it.
- **`scheduler.css` carries measured contracts, not preferences.**
- **Every bug fix lands with a test that pins it**; new features get new
  tests. Never weaken a failing assertion — understand it.
- **Keep `../HANDOFF.md` true in the same PR.** A change that resolves (or
  creates) a known issue edits its list; a change that adds, removes or
  renames a file edits its file map. Stale is worse than absent — the next
  session trusts it.

## Stable decisions (do not relitigate)

- `reference/` is **read-only** — the spec for existing behaviour. New
  features go beyond it but must not break it.
- The engine was historically generated from the original; that generator
  is **deleted** (git history keeps it). Never recreate or rerun it — the
  engine is ordinary source now and regenerating would clobber real work.
- Keep `src/probe-bridge.ts` in sync when adding engine API.
- Product: no rule versioning · no two-person approval · no "publish all
  days" · OIL is LL-equivalent · sim notes are single-line · pucks never
  wrap · login page stays simple · the talon logo stays · a clicked warning
  lights its crew in the warning colours, never selection blue (owner
  declined the blue, 7 Aug 26 — blue is the puck-click selection only) ·
  **no My Programme page** (owner, 7 Aug 26 — a personal week-as-cards view
  was built, shipped and removed the same day: "don't find a use for it for
  now"; do not re-propose it unless the owner raises it, and if he does,
  the removed implementation is one `git revert` away in history).
- **No drag-to-section** (owner, Aug 26 — dropped after the buttons shipped).
  Moving an `Other` row to Ground or Unavailable is the `→ Ground` /
  `→ Unavail` buttons in `html.ts`, on both the week and the board. Don't add
  drop targets to `drag.ts` for it; that machine stays scoped to pucks.
