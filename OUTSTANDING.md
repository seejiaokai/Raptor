# Outstanding & standby tasks

A running backlog of work deferred or placed on standby, so it can be picked up
in a future session. Companion to `HANDOFF.md`; this is the "not now, but don't
lose it" list.

**To resume:** read this file first, then the relevant design record (linked per
item).

> ## Maintaining this file — do this every time it's touched
> - **Completed** → move the item to **Done** at the bottom, with the date and a
>   one-line "how it was resolved."
> - **Deferred again / changed** → update the item's status and note why, and
>   adjust its place in the priority list.
> - **Re-order the priority list whenever items change** — by *logical* order,
>   not habit: what's actionable now, what's blocked, dependencies, and effort
>   vs. risk. Call out any non-obvious ordering in one line.
> - **Before adding an item, verify it isn't already done** (check git log /
>   `main` / the code) — don't backlog completed work.
> - Keep it true, like `HANDOFF.md`. A stale backlog is worse than none.
> - Item **IDs are stable** (`[AMEND]`, `[OIL]`…); priority is a separate
>   ordered list that references them, so re-prioritising never renumbers items.
> - **Rich context → a committed context doc.** When a task carries reasoning worth
>   keeping (why a decision went that way, research, rejected options, mockup links),
>   capture it in a committed doc in the repo and link it from the item's **Context**
>   line — so the next session pulls the *thinking* out, not just the task title.
>   Don't leave the reasoning only in a chat; the chat is gone next session.

**Model guidance (owner's standing rule):** build / voluminous multi-file / lots
of reading → **Opus 4.8, default**; hard-reasoning review, bug-check, verify or a
tricky design call → **Fable 5.1, high**; mechanical / low-risk → a cheaper model.

## Priority — logical order (updated 13 Sep 2026)

**NEW backbone (owner, 13 Sep 26): [ARCH-STACK]** — a whole-app architectural review (both
providers) reframed much of the backlog as ONE ordered stack (stable ids → one write/command
layer → global undo → one-Absence-record → storage door/DB → remove quarantine). Owner's rule:
**fix the architecture first, then individual bugs.** `[GLOBAL-UNDO]`, `[INP-CSID]`, `[TRK-CSID]`,
`[DB-STEP]` are STEPS of it. The immediate next build is **stable ids (step 1)** — cheap,
independent. STOP: interim two-system undo patches + further quarantine rounds.

Below is the older item ordering (kept for the non-stack items); land what's **cheap, done, or
in-flight and risk-reducing** first.

1. **[AMEND]** — the main project. Decisions resolved; brief re-frozen & re-reviewed;
   **CORE built + round-3 in progress** on `claude/amendment-engine-core`. **[BUG2]**
   folds in here.
2. **[SYNC-INTEG]** — now just the small NON-undo guardrails (medical member-filed,
   clutter-only clear-data, Quals ✕ confirm, doc fix). Low urgency (pre-live); cheap batch.
   *The undo/permission half was pulled out into [GLOBAL-UNDO] (owner, 13 Sep 26).*
3. **[EOD]** — the end-of-day feature split out of [AMEND]; design-first follow-on,
   after the core lands.
4. **[OIL]** — depends on [AMEND]; do straight after.
5. **[TRK-CSID]** / **[INP-CSID]** — the stable-id work (Tracker courses/syllabuses;
   schedule personal inputs); independent, medium, not urgent.
6. **[TRK-ATTEMPTS]** — small new feature, low urgency.
7. **[RECALL]** — future feature (fresh recall from archive); design when reached.
8. **[GLOBAL-UNDO]** — the one-global-undo re-architecture; a step **before** [DB-STEP]
   (must land before going live). Absorbs [XWEEK-UNDO] and the whole delete/undo bug family.
9. **[DB-STEP]** / **[XFER]** — the future database milestone and multi-squadron
   transfer; **[TRK-DISK]** (Decision A) is fixed inside [DB-STEP].

*(Done 12 Sep 2026: **[TRK-IMPORT]** and **[TRK-LEDGER]** — both merged live; see Done.)*

## In plain terms (quick read)

One line each, no jargon:

- **[AMEND] — The amendment engine rebuild (the big one).** Each day gets its own
  amendments, published is locked, every change is a new AL, no take-backs. Decisions
  made; now being built, phase by phase. The end-of-day "record actuals" part is split
  off as **[EOD]** to build later.
- **[EOD] — The end-of-day "what actually flew" record.** A quick end-of-day note of
  what really happened (scrubs, changes), with no sign-off. Designed, but it needs its
  own careful round before building — set aside so the main rebuild ships first.
- **[OIL] — Don't wipe off-in-lieu someone already earned.** Removing a person by
  amendment currently erases their weekend/holiday OIL — wrong if they'd already
  worked the day. Lock it once the day's been worked. After the amendment rebuild.
- **[BUG2] — Double-check one suspected bug.** A reopen button might act on the wrong
  version while you're viewing history — Astra thinks it may not actually happen.
  Quick check, folded into the amendment work.
- **[SYNC-INTEG] — Small safety guardrails for leave.** Medical can only be filed by the
  member (not created on the Leave War); the "clear old data" button only clears clutter and
  never touches leave/balances; a warning on the Quals ✕; a doc fix. (The bigger delete/undo
  fixes moved to [GLOBAL-UNDO].) Low urgency — we're not live yet.
- **[GLOBAL-UNDO] — One undo for the whole app, before the database step.** Today each
  section has its own separate undo, and that's the root of the weird delete/undo bugs. One
  shared undo (per login session, never touching another user) removes that whole class of
  bugs instead of patching each. A step to do before going live / before the database.
- **[RECALL] — Bring a posted-out person back, fresh.** When someone leaves the whole app
  and returns, they come back with new quals and new leave balances (past kept as record) —
  not their old ones. Future feature.
- **[XWEEK-UNDO] — Undo across weeks (part of [GLOBAL-UNDO]).** If you undo something on a
  week you're not viewing, the app takes you to that week and shows what changed. Built as
  part of the one-global-undo step.
- **[XFER] — Move a person to another squadron, data intact.** In the multi-squadron future,
  transferring someone carries all their data across (unlike leaving the system, which resets).
- **[INP-CSID] — Give leave/personal inputs a permanent hidden tag.** Like schedule rows and
  students already have, so two look-alike entries can't cross when one is deleted.
- **[TRK-CSID] — Give courses and syllabuses a permanent hidden tag.** Students and
  schedule rows already have one (so they survive being moved or renamed); courses
  and syllabuses don't yet, so renaming one is riskier. Medium job, not urgent.
- **[TRK-ATTEMPTS] — Remember a student's earlier attempts.** Today only the latest
  grade is kept; this would keep the earlier tries too. Small new feature.
- **[TRK-DISK] — A rare "nearly-full storage" data-loss gap.** On upgrades or renames
  the app trusts its own memory instead of confirming the save really reached storage
  before deleting the original. Rare, mostly self-heals. Best fixed with the database
  step.
- **[DB-STEP] — The big future move to a shared database.** Today everything saves
  only in your own browser — nothing is shared across people or devices. This is the
  large future project (Dataverse) that several parked items fold into.

## Items

### [AMEND] Amendment engine redesign — CORE BUILDING (decisions resolved)
Rebuild the publish/amend/version model: per-day isolated numbering (never
week-wide), published = immutable, every change a new AL, supersede-never-retract,
undo cannot cross a publish, load-old-version → republish-as-next-AL as the safe
recovery path.
- **Decisions RESOLVED (owner, 12 Sep 26):** plans SURVIVE as backups; ALL FOUR roles
  re-sign every amendment; crew SEE the live draft (issued stays authority). OIL for
  this build = latest AL/Original per day, per-day, read-failure protection (the
  worked-day lock stays **[OIL]**).
- **Reviewed:** the design brief was re-frozen (Rev 3) and re-reviewed by BOTH providers
  (converged), then Rev 4 owner additions (EOD, OIL simplification, plan names) got a
  further Astra/Codex red-team → Rev 5. Plan naming passed clean; the EOD findings
  (REV5-01…05) are why EOD is split out (see **[EOD]**).
- **Must-build (still in scope):** AM-01 date-qualified version IDs; AM-02 versioned
  saved-week migration (incl. Leave War's direct reads); AM-04 what a published version
  captures; AM-06 signatures bound to content; AM-09 durable write/lease.
- **Now:** building the CORE test-first on `claude/amendment-engine-core`, phase by
  phase; full gates per phase; **no merge without "merge live"**; fresh Codex inspection
  of the final code.
- **Model:** build on Opus 4.8 (high); final code inspection on Codex; Fable reserved
  for a single high-stakes finding.
- **Context & records (read to resume):** the build plan
  `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-amendment-core-build-plan.md` (phases +
  proofs), the frozen spec `…-amendment-core-build-brief.md`, the decisions doc
  `…-2026-09-11-amendment-model-decisions.md` (rationale, mockups §10), and the review
  log `…-amendment-rev4-rev5-review-log.md`.

### [EOD] End-of-Day "record actuals" — DEFERRED (design follow-on, after [AMEND] core)
The end-of-day actuals record: a distinct end-of-day publish that captures what actually
flew (scrubs, deviations), labelled EOD, with **no four-role sign-off** — just "recorded
by X". Owner designed it 12 Sep; split out of the core build because an unsigned publish
path in a clock-free app needs its own design cycle. Astra/Codex REV5 findings to resolve:
- **REV5-01** the "day is closed" boundary is scheduler-asserted with no eligibility rule
  → a future day could be closed+EOD'd to publish an unsigned plan change; the app has no
  clock (`weeknav.ts TODAY` fixed). Needs a real "day is done" mechanism or a narrowed,
  documented trust guarantee (EOD is never the forward-plan authority).
- **REV5-04** "worked" ≠ "marked closed": a worked-as-planned day gets no EOD and stays
  unclosed, so a later AL can still strip its OIL; legacy worked days too. Needs a
  no-content-change closure path + treatment of unclosed/legacy worked dates.
- **REV5-02** a late OIL acknowledgement (`reviseOil`→`row.oil`, no publication gate) has
  no defined transition into an immutable/closed day.
- **REV5-03** pick ONE correction transition (corrections are EOD-kind, not signed AL).
- **REV5-05** closing a day doesn't freeze holiday eligibility (`setDayEvent` removing a
  PH → `runOilPass` deletes the credit, no closed-day guard); freeze the non-working basis.
- **Design record:** the EOD design is preserved in §3b of `…-amendment-core-build-brief.md`;
  findings + dispositions in the review log. **Model:** design-first, red-team both
  providers again before building; then Opus build + Codex inspection.

### [OIL] Lock earned OIL on an already-worked day — STANDBY (after [AMEND])
An amendment that removes a person re-derives Leave War auto-OIL from the current
published version and sweeps it away — correct for a **future** day, wrong for a
**past** day already worked.
- **Decision (owner leaning, 11 Sep 26):** earned OIL on an already-worked day is
  **locked**; amendments only affect OIL for days not yet flown. Exception: an
  amendment whose explicit purpose is "he didn't work it after all."
- **Cross-feature, verified:** `src/leavewar/sync.ts` `runOilPass`/`desiredOilCells`
  + `src/engine/oil.ts`; acknowledged claims (`row.oil`) are the only sticky source
  today. Sequenced after [AMEND].
- **Model:** build on Opus; a Fable-high bug-check (touches money + saved data).

### [BUG2] Verify the reopen control during version preview — SMALL (folds into [AMEND])
Astra says the original Bug 2 may **not** reproduce (EditWeek `ed=false`; SchedBoard
`pv=true` → no controls emitted). Verify; keep the defensive handler guards.
- **Model:** Fable, high — short, focused verification.

### [ARCH-STACK] The architectural root-cause stack — the backbone (both providers, 13 Sep 26)
**STEP 1A DONE + LIVE (13 Sep 26, PR #396):** stable ids on the scheduler side — input filing by
`iid` (`[INP-CSID]` done), day notes as `{rid,t}` objects, coordinated storage-format reset;
plus a history-ordering determinism fix and a cross-week accepted-input edit/delete guard. Both
providers inspected the built code; all findings fixed. Remaining in step 1: **1B** (`[TRK-CSID]`,
Tracker ids — Fable-high final) and **1C** (`who→personId`, parity-sensitive, its own pass). One
deferred follow-up (finding 2, orphaned `Other` hard-grade) noted below.
A whole-app architectural review by BOTH Astra and Fable (read-only) converged on one story:
the app is **one store-pattern built three times** (Scheduler / Leave War / Tracker), and it
knows only THAT something changed, never WHAT. The fix is a **record-level change stream over
stable ids** that undo, persistence, sync and the database all consume — build once, not four
times. Several existing items are STEPS of this stack. **Full plan (root causes, order, effort,
what to stop):** `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-architecture-rootcause-plan.md`.
- **Order:** (1) stable ids everywhere [INP-CSID]/[TRK-CSID] + `who→personId`/note-ids/`iid`→UUID;
  (1b) quick wins — landing-on-row, a session-reset registry, ISO dates, the `mod:'now'`
  late-mark fix; (2) ONE write/command layer (all 3 modules, PEOPLE/settings included);
  (3) global per-session undo as inverse-patch [GLOBAL-UNDO]; (4) ONE Absence record (design NOW,
  before the Dataverse tables freeze); (5) record-oriented storage door → Dataverse [DB-STEP];
  (6) remove the quarantine/legacy machinery.
- **Stop now:** interim two-system undo patches and further quarantine rounds (both replaced by
  steps 2–3 and 6). Only the small [SYNC-INTEG] guardrails remain worth doing pre-stack.
- **Model/process:** HEAVY, foundational. Each step: design → red-team (Astra lead, Fable for the
  crux) → build → inspect → gates → hold for "merge live". Start with (1) — cheap, independent.
- **Context:** the plan doc above (synthesises both reviews); memories
  `architectural-root-cause-before-minute-fixes`, `future-undo-semantics-multiuser`.
- **1A follow-ups (post-build inspection, 13 Sep 26):** two faces of the cross-week accepted-input
  LANDING model that step (4) "one Absence record" dissolves. (a) **DONE now (owner: guard):** editing/
  deleting an accepted input whose ground row is on a non-loaded week is refused with "Load the week
  of <date>…" (was a silent stale link under stable ids) — `inputedit.tsx:landedOnUnloadedWeek`. (b)
  **DEFERRED to step (4):** an accepted `Other` whose input is later deleted loses its hard-clash
  grade (orphaned row → `shiftHardGround` can't resolve the type; narrow — Fable inspect #2). Fix
  when landings become the one Absence record, or a cheap `srcType` on the ground row if it surfaces.

### [SYNC-INTEG] Leave War ↔ inputs guardrails (NON-undo part) — small, ready
A read-only cross-provider audit (Codex + Fable, 13 Sep 26) of DELETE/UNDO across the
Leave War ↔ inputs ↔ documents seams found a family of data-integrity + permission
issues. **All decisions, findings and the fix plan are in**
`raptor-port/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-sync-delete-undo-integrity-spec.md`.
**DECISION 13 Sep 26 (owner):** the whole UNDO/permission half of this — the delete-vs-undo
resurrection, the undo-family bugs, and the member-undoes-admin gap — is NOT patched here;
it is dissolved wholesale by a single **global undo re-architecture → see [GLOBAL-UNDO]**,
done as a step BEFORE the database. Do NOT build interim two-system undo patches (they'd be
thrown away). Rationale: pre-promulgation demo data (no live users), and the root cause is
having two separate undo systems over shared data — remove the root, don't patch each face.
- **What REMAINS here (independent of undo, small guardrails):** P2 medical is member-filed
  only (block creation on the war for all roles + hide the war medical pickers; existing =
  demo, reset — no migration); P4 "Clear old data" is CLUTTER-ONLY (old pucks/day-notes/empty
  past weeks; never deletes any leave/medical/duty input; never the loaded week); P6 a Quals ✕
  confirm; P7 fix CLAUDE.md's stale "Leave War session-only" line.
- **Urgency:** low (pre-live); do as a cheap batch when convenient. Model: Opus build,
  gates, no merge without "merge live".
- **Context:** the spec/record above (findings, dispositions).

### [GLOBAL-UNDO] One global per-session undo — a step BEFORE the database
**Decision (owner, 13 Sep 26):** replace the current SEPARATE per-section undo stacks
(schedule / Leave War / Tracker) with ONE global, per-session, per-user undo timeline. The
whole delete/undo weird-behaviour family exists BECAUSE two independent undo systems sit over
the same synced data and disagree; one timeline removes that class of bugs at the root instead
of patching each. **Do this as a dedicated step BEFORE [DB-STEP]** (it unifies the section
stores' history, which the DB step needs anyway), NOT as a mid-fix patch now.
- **Absorbs (do not fix separately):** the delete-vs-undo resurrection (finding A/P1), the
  undo-family bugs (D, E, F, I), the member-undoes-admin permission gap (C/DU-001/P3), per-week
  undo that survives navigation, and the [XWEEK-UNDO] snap-to-page idea.
- **Rules to honour (owner):** undo scoped to the LOGIN SESSION (logout clears it), never
  affects another user, others see every change live from the shared DB; undo only reverses
  your own actions; a role/viewer PREVIEW must not wipe an admin's undo.
- **Gate:** must be done before promulgation / real users (the interim bugs are tolerable only
  because it's demo data).
- **Context:** the sync spec (findings A/C/D/E/F/I + the red-team on why the two-system patch
  is the wrong approach); memories `future-undo-semantics-multiuser` (architecture direction),
  `multi-squadron-and-person-transfer`; ties to `docs/architecture-direction.md` + [DB-STEP].

### [RECALL] Fresh recall from archive — FUTURE FEATURE
An admin recalls an archived person back into Quals. **Behaviour (owner, 13 Sep 26):**
leaving the whole app SYSTEM then being posted back = **FRESH** — new/updated quals and
new Leave War balances; only past history stays frozen. NOT "restored exactly as they
left." Replaces the current Quals ✕ / "Restore exactly" behaviour (see [SYNC-INTEG] P6).
- **Context:** the sync spec §Parked; memories `multi-squadron-and-person-transfer`,
  `future-undo-semantics-multiuser`.

### [XWEEK-UNDO] Cross-week "snap-to-page" undo — FUTURE FEATURE
**Behaviour (owner, 13 Sep 26):** undoing something not on the current page snaps you to
that week and shows what the undo did. Builds on Phase 2's per-week persistent undo.
Future multi-user rules: undo is scoped to the login SESSION (logout clears it), never
affects another user, but others see every change live from the shared DB.
- **Context:** the sync spec §Parked; memory `future-undo-semantics-multiuser`.

### [XFER] Multi-squadron + transfer a person with their data — FUTURE MILESTONE (with [DB-STEP])
**Behaviour (owner, 13 Sep 26):** many squadrons on one app / one backend; transferring a
person BETWEEN squadrons carries ALL their data across (quals, history, leave) — distinct
from leaving the system entirely, which is a fresh return. The identity model must let one
person move between squadrons with data intact.
- **Context:** memory `multi-squadron-and-person-transfer`; ties to
  `docs/architecture-direction.md` and [DB-STEP].

### [INP-CSID] Stable ids for personal inputs — DONE (13 Sep 2026, ARCH-STACK 1A item 1)
Delivered by ARCH-STACK step 1A: personal inputs are filed/accepted/undone/edited by their
stable opaque `iid` (`newId('i')`), not the content key `inpKey`. Twins file independently and
the accept guard is a same-input idempotency check; `inpKey` stays only as a display/dedup hint.
Merged live in PR #396. Finding J (`DU-007`) closed.

### [TRK-CSID] Give courses & syllabuses their own hidden ids — OPEN (medium)
Students and schedule rows now carry stable hidden ids (rename/reorder-safe);
**courses and syllabuses do not** — they're still keyed by name, so renaming a
course/syllabus still moves data by name and is not as safe as renaming a student.
Give them their own ids so a rename becomes identity-stable too. (Verified open:
no course/syllabus id in `tracker/app/core.js`/`ids.js`; CLAUDE.md still treats
their names as storage-key segments.)
- **Model:** build on Opus (multi-file plumbing); a Fable-high final review
  (persisted data, silent-defect risk).

### [TRK-ATTEMPTS] Keep a student's attempt history — OPEN (small, feature)
Remember a student's *earlier* tries at an event, not just the latest grade. More a
new feature than a cleanup. (Verified open: no attempt-history in `tracker/`.)
- **Model:** build on Opus, default; small, clear spec.

### [TRK-DISK] Tracker migration/rename "safety check" reads memory, not disk — Decision A — OPEN
On upgrade or a course/syllabus rename, the app copies records, checks the copy in
**working memory**, then deletes the originals — so a failed disk write (storage
full) can delete an original before its copy is safely saved. Same gap on syllabus
rename. Largely self-healing; bites only near-full storage + tab closed before the
retry (more likely on iPhone). Never fixed, not logged as a limitation.
- **Fix within [DB-STEP]:** a real "it's saved" signal the delete waits for, rather
  than a piecemeal patch in three places. Or pull earlier on request.

### [DB-STEP] The shared-database step (Dataverse) — FUTURE MILESTONE
The big future move: Raptor, Leave War and Tracker all run on `localStorage` /
session today; the target is a shared database (**Dataverse** — `src/storage/`
seam, `docs/data-model.md`). Large, design-first, its own red-team. Several parked
items are meant to be resolved here — notably **[TRK-DISK]** (the memory-not-disk
save signal) and the Tracker's dropped SharePoint/Dataverse/Firebase layers.
- **Model:** design review on Fable, high (the expensive-to-get-wrong decision);
  build volume on Opus.

## Done

### [TRK-IMPORT] Tracker import-conflict refusal — DONE (12 Sep 2026)
Import now refuses when a file names a *different person* under a callsign already
on the course, before writing anything — so the existing student is no longer
silently dropped and their marks orphaned. Rebased on current `main`, full gates
green, independent Astra/Codex bug-check run **on the fix**: it found the refusal
scan read only the per-syllabus rosters and missed a course still on the ORIGINAL
pre-syllabus flat roster (v3:<c>:roster), which a conflicting import could still
overwrite. Closed that (the scan reads the flat roster + its links too) and made
the refusal message honest that charts imported first may already be in. Astra
re-check: sound. Merged as **PR #386**, deployed, confirmed live (Tracker renders,
no console errors).

### [TRK-LEDGER] Tracker legacy-import ledger (Decision B) — DONE (12 Sep 2026)
A half-finished first-time legacy import used to seal itself done on the first
`raptor:` key and hide the rest forever; it now resumes via a per-key ledger and
grandfathers existing installs. Rebased on `main`, gates green, Astra bug-check on
the fix found a residual: if the store was so full that even the ledger write
failed, the next boot grandfathered and lost the rest. Closed with a
`__legacy__/started` marker written before the first copy, and gated persistence on
that marker being durable (a persisted record always has its marker). One inherent
corner documented (a record deleted seconds after migration on an already-full
store can be re-copied — resume without a durable ledger can't tell "not copied"
from "copied then deleted"). Astra re-check: sound. Merged as **PR #387**, deployed,
confirmed live.

### [SEC-ALTIP] AL panel tooltip HTML injection (AM-08) — DONE (11 Sep 2026)
The amendment sign-off tooltip could run injected code from a crafted callsign;
it's now escaped at display time, so already-saved names are covered too. Verified
end to end: merged as **PR #393** to `main` (CI green), deployed, and confirmed on
the live site (Amendments panel renders normally, no errors). Found by the
Astra/Codex amendment review; fixed in its own spawned session.
