# HANDOFF — where things stand, and what is next

**A new chat reads this first.** It is the ONE handoff (D140, 24 Sep 26): `## Now` holds one block per open chat's
branch — where it stands, what it left, what to do next — and `## Next, in order` is the project's order; below
them, the standing facts. It holds CURRENT state only: a finished story is in git and, when a whole section left,
in `raptor-port/docs/archive/` (the 4 Sep 26 snapshot of this file is `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`, frozen); open work is
in `OUTSTANDING.md`; where each kind of fact goes is `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md`, loaded in every chat.

**Before acting on a block:** `git fetch`, then check the branch and PR it names — it describes the world when it
was written. Never push while a PR's checks are running (D151) — a push starts two runs, so read them all: `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 6 --json status,workflowName,headSha`, none of the last pushed commit `queued` or `in_progress` (D870).
Bring the checkout level BEFORE reading this file: a chat continuing a pushed branch runs `git pull --ff-only`; a fresh
worktree has no upstream, so "git pull" pulls nothing there — `git fetch origin`, then `git merge --ff-only origin/main`.
List the live chats (`ListAgents`): if the one that wrote
the block is still running, or another already holds the item you were told to start, message it and agree who owns
each remaining step before touching anything. If your opening message and the block's "Opening line" or "Pick up
here" differ, name the difference to him and ask before starting.
**Writing a block** (the session-handoff skill does it, at every handoff): rewrite ONLY your own block, between its
markers, even when nothing is pending; newest block first; remove another chat's block only after `git fetch` shows
its work merged and its open residue is filed in `OUTSTANDING.md`. Two parallel chats each keep their own block, and
the later merge keeps both (D78).

## Now
<!-- now:claude/rules-diet-step-3-f1a069 -->
### `claude/rules-diet-step-3-f1a069` — [RULES-DIET] step 3, reading by section: BUILT, READ AND MEASURED; its pull request into `main` waits for his "merge live" (D1737); written 7 Nov 26, 20:35 (compacted at about 19:34 and 20:27) — verify before use
- **Where it started:** `main` at `32ac5bd59` (step 2 live, pull request 657). Commits: `ab8598e70` (drafts), `cf81dc275` (measure), `6f9e2dbbc` (the Opus meaning read folded in), `47cf3ef81` and `b1a5e682b` (the two script reads' fixes), `d743a96b7` (Astra's read folded in), then the reports, the review log and this block.
- **What it does:** the bug-check order is read through its checklist, `raptor-port/docs/bug-check-checklist.md`, step by step, each section a step names read whole; the design guide by the section list in `.claude/rules/ui-design.md`; the ripple map by the note at its head; `docsize --reads` counts each by part (D1736). The pointers to them (`bug-check.md`, the order's §0a, the project guide's map rows, `guide-full.md`) say "by section".
- **The four reads, all folded in:** the meaning of the three routes, by a fresh blind Opus reader (16 findings) and by Astra (8, his call — D1739); the reads measure, by two fresh Opus readers (D1736). Reports: `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/briefs/2026-11-07-rules-diet-step3-read-opus.md`, `…-read-astra.md`, `…-reads-script-read-opus.md`, `…-reads-script-reread-opus.md`; what each found, what was done, and the two meaning reads compared: the plan's §Step 3, "Step 3's reads". The full self-test passed 312 on `b1a5e682b`; `npm run docsize` passes.
- **Measured** (the plan's §Step 3, against `main`): the three reads 119,787 → 98,547 tokens (−18%; the plan said ~29,000); each job about 7% less. Far less than planned because every section a step names stays a whole read (D1735's own condition) and his design lessons are half the guide.
- **Next:** (1) his "merge live" — it changes two always-loaded rule files, so it is not a notes-only merge (D1737, D1407); on it, push nothing, wait for GitHub's run green, merge, confirm. (2) Then the plan's §7: the re-measure is in §Step 3; step 4, the every-chat layer, in a fresh chat, read by Astra and a fresh Opus reader, each blind (D1739).
- **Rulings:** none this session. **Open question for him (carried from step 2):** [CONTEXT-START-SIZE] keeps only E, his own setting — archive it by script if he agrees.
- **Opening line (once merged):** "Start the rules diet's step 4, the every-chat layer: `git fetch origin`, then a new branch from `origin/main`. Read `HANDOFF.md`, `OUTSTANDING.md` [RULES-DIET] and the plan (`raptor-port/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-07-rules-diet-plan.md` §3, §5, §7 and §Step 3), then do step 4."

## Next, in order

**RIGHT NOW (7 Nov 26):** the rules diet (`[RULES-DIET]`, plan `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-07-rules-diet-plan.md` §7) — step 1 LIVE (pull request 656) → step 2 LIVE (pull request 657) → step 3, reading by section, its pull request on `claude/rules-diet-step-3-f1a069` waiting for his "merge live" (its block; re-measured: about 7% of a job's read) → step 4, the every-chat layer → step 5a, the small areas, OIL first → re-measure and report to him → step 5b, the big three; each step on his "merge live" (D1737).

*(The "RIGHT NOW" lines of 6 Oct to 5 Nov 26, with his two words of 12 Oct 26 (D774, D775 — rulings in `how-we-work.md`) — all done, live or filed — are in `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-right-now-2026-11-07.md`, moved whole on 7 Nov 26; more of 13 to 20 Oct 26 in `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-right-now-2026-10-20.md`.)*

0. **THE DATABASE COMES AT THE END (D473, 1 Oct 26 — replaces D354's "starts now"):** the app's features are built first; after
   phase 7 no more database-readiness work until then; the table list (`raptor-port/docs/data-model.md`) is kept up to date as
   each feature is added, and he — with his AI — writes the table format for the IT side to enter. `[WARN-HIDE-KEPT]` is BUILT, FULL-checked and MERGED (1 Oct 26, PR #478); `[INSIGHTS-WHICH-COPY]` (D477, D478) BUILT, WALK-checked and MERGED on his "merge live" (1 Oct 26, PR #479). **Next (D483): `[WORKSPAN-NEGATIVE]`** — the negative work-hours fault, in a fresh chat, with the second Sonnet-walker trial on its walk (D480); then `[INSIGHTS-BOARD-DOOR]` (D481).
   *Done while the step was "starting now" (29 Sep – 1 Oct 26):* `[IT-FLOW-GUIDE]` DONE (the guide for IT, `raptor-port/docs/it-flow-guide/`, 29 Sep 26); `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design DONE and merged (PR #475); `[DB-READINESS]` group A PLANNED 30 Sep 26 (plan v4,
   `claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6`) — its build under way: phases 0–5 and 5b built 30 Sep 26, the group's FULL check done (the walk and both code reads, every finding fixed); phase 6 (a), (b), (d) built and FULL-checked 30 Sep 26 (`raptor-port/docs/handpass/2026-09-30-dbr-phase6-check.md`); phase 6 (c) v3 built and FULL-checked 1 Oct 26 on `claude/db-readiness-p6c-holder-base` (D467 — `…/2026-10-01-dbr-phase6c-check.md`) — phases 0–6 MERGED 1 Oct 26 on his "merge live" (PR #476); phase 7, the small OIL follow-ups, BUILT and FULL-checked 1 Oct 26 (`…/2026-10-01-dbr-phase7-check.md`) and MERGED the same day on his "merge live" (PR #477) — group A is closed (D453); `[WARN-HIDE-KEPT]` (D469, D471, D472, D475) BUILT, FULL-checked and MERGED 1 Oct 26 (PR #478). The IT team is taking the app into Dataverse now, and he means to
   keep working on the app beside it. What to finish before the hand-over was put to him the same day; record his answer
   here and in `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list the moment he gives it. Everything below keeps its ORDER; its timing is overtaken — *and that hand-over now waits for the end (D473).*
1. **HIS ORDER to the database step (D203, 26 Sep 26 — its timing overtaken by D354):** `[ACCOUNTS]`, `[ACCOUNTS-NEW-PERSON]`,
   `[POST-OUT-OUTCOMES]`, `[LW-MOVE-STANDARD]` (D264–D266) and `[ONE-DOOR]` (D309, D310, with `[POST-IN-DATE]`) MERGED
   (PRs #442, #443, #446, #447, #450) → **the one changes window (`[DRAFT-PENDING]`)** MERGED (PR #451, 28 Sep 26); its
   two follow-ups `[HIST-PHONE-HIDE]` and `[CHG-BY-ITEM]` (D345, D346) MERGED (PR #455, 28 Sep 26); beside it, he talks to the IT side
   (`[IT-QUESTIONS]`). Development as normal: `[HUMAN-RETEST]`'s remaining three in his order (D147 — the absence record
   with `[S4-HUNT-REST]` and D260–D262 MERGED, PR #444 — then change-recording, the Leave War links last), then `[LW-LOCKMARK]` → `[LW-WEEKDAY-WORK]` (`[PUB-UNAVAIL]`
   closed by the absence-record re-test).
2. **HIS ORDER NOW (D453, 29 Sep 26):** `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design fixed with the red team's findings → `[DB-READINESS]`
   **group A** (what decides the tables' shape — saving in small pieces, the schedule a day per piece, the change log, no
   week-deleting reconcile, the planning calendar's own records, no demo seed; with the small OIL follow-ups, D147) BEFORE
   IT settles its tables → the app connected (`[DB-STEP]`) → **group B** (tuned against the real database) → the lock's
   screens. *(D473, 1 Oct 26: group A is built; the connection, group B and the lock's screens wait for the end — there is no
   "before its tables settle" to race now.)* The whole list: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
3. Filed, none blocking: `[TRK-PINCH-ASK]` (his iPhone look), `[LW-FROZEN-BAR-GAP]`; the Tracker leftovers'
   own residue — `[SAVE-NOTE-COVERS]` (built on `codex/save-note-controls`, 5 Oct 26 — his look and "merge live" left), `[TRK-REMOUNT-LANDING]`, `[TRK-ASYNC-STALE]` (with `[DB-READINESS]`). Everything else: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
4. **Before ANY collaborator:** take the checks runner off this repo (Astra SEC-101, `[REPO-PRIVATE]`).

## Gate baseline

**The latest counts watched — 19 Oct 26, `claude/schedule-amendments-fixes-fffce0` at `40c7af45e` (`main` with the D994 batch, every fix of its check in — NOT `main`'s code), the whole gate set under the PC lock in one run, browser tests on 4232: build clean · tfin 728 / 0 · unit 11855 / 11855 · e2e 865 passed, 0 failed, 61 skipped · smoke 453 / 0 · rulecheck OK · docsize OK — WHOLLY GREEN.** (The run before it, at `9cbdc5e64`, met the Leave War phone test of `[LW-WINDOW-PRUNE-FLAKE-2]` once — 2 of 3 alone.)

Older counts, 9–19 Oct 26: moved whole to `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-gate-baseline-2026-11-07.md` (D1733).

Only the newest count stays in this section: when a newer one is written, the one it replaces moves whole to that archive file (D1733).

## Standing constraints

Every one of these is the same missing piece — the server / sync backend —
wearing a different hat.

- **No shared data.** localStorage only; two devices never see each other's
  edits. Needs a server or sync backend; touches the storage seam (`raptor-port/src/storage/`,
  `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live) and the mutation funnel. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: it used to name
  `engine/hooks.ts:storeBackend`, which the storage seam replaced for everything but the `sqn142_*` settings.)*
- **Prototype auth.** *(Rewritten 26 Sep 26 by `[ACCOUNTS]`, on its branch.)* Accounts — one per person, tied to a
  callsign, managed on Admin → Users; the sign-in stands for the defence mail's and the app keeps no password; people on
  no list ask for access (D166, D204). Like all data, they live in one browser until the database, and the sign-in is no
  security (the app sits behind his Vercel sign-in — Vercel's lock, not the app's). A member is NOT view-only: they
  add, edit and delete their own Inputs and edit their own Quals row (D149).
  Roles table `docs/engine-rules.md` §Auth / roles; ONE permissions module (`raptor-port/src/state/perms.ts`,
  mirroring `data-model.md` §11, drift-tested); enforcement at the page, the write path and the command gate.
- **One dataset.** The schedule is the demo week (Mon 13 – Sun 19 Jul 26; the
  weekend is non-flying, duty crew only). Week chips re-label but every week
  shows the same data. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: a second demo week is authored from Mon 20 Jul —
  `raptor-port/src/engine/week2.ts` — and a week once edited keeps its own copy, persisted; an untouched week
  still falls back to the seed.)*
- **What survives a reload** — nearly everything, on a built site (the 19 Aug "session-only" rule was superseded 17 Sep 26 and its text archived in `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-2026-09-24.md`): the authoritative table is `raptor-port/docs/data-schema.md`; the short form is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §WHAT ACTUALLY PERSISTS.

## Where to look

The map of every document is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live (it loads with any file under
`raptor-port/`). From the root: the backlog `OUTSTANDING.md`, the rulings map `DECISIONS.md`, and — loaded in every
chat — `.claude/rules/shipping.md` (how a change ships) and `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md` (where each fact goes).
