# HANDOFF — where things stand, and what is next

**A new chat reads this first.** It is the ONE handoff (D140, 24 Sep 26): `## Now` holds one block per open chat's
branch — where it stands, what it left, what to do next — and `## Next, in order` is the project's order; below
them, the standing facts. It holds CURRENT state only: a finished story is in git and, when a whole section left,
in `raptor-port/docs/archive/` (the 4 Sep 26 snapshot of this file is `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`, frozen); open work is
in `OUTSTANDING.md`; where each kind of fact goes is `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md`, loaded in every chat.

**Before acting on a block:** `git fetch`, then check the branch and PR it names — it describes the world when it
was written. Never push while a PR's checks are running (`gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1`; D151).
**Writing a block** (the session-handoff skill does it, at every handoff): rewrite ONLY your own block, between its
markers, even when nothing is pending; newest block first; remove another chat's block only after `git fetch` shows
its work merged and its open residue is filed in `OUTSTANDING.md`. Two parallel chats each keep their own block, and
the later merge keeps both (D78).

## Now

<!-- now:claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6 -->
### `claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6` — `[DB-READINESS]` group A PLANNED (plan v4, final; both reviewers, three rounds at his cap); the build is next — documents only so far — written 30 Sep 26 — verify before use
- **Where it started:** his ask: plan group A (D453 — the table-shaping half, before IT settles its tables) and have both
  reviewers red-team it before building. On the way he ruled D460–D463 and reported from IT "no plugin for now" (heard,
  unconfirmed — `OUTSTANDING.md` `[IT-QUESTIONS]`).
- **Shipped (on this branch, pushed, no PR yet):** the plan `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-db-readiness-group-a-plan.md`
  (v4 — §2 decisions and the record→table matrix, §3 phases 0–7 with 5b the Tracker, §8 round 3's binding build checklist);
  three rounds of both reviewers and their dispositions in `raptor-port/docs/superpowers/briefs/2026-09-30-db-readiness-group-a-*.md`;
  D461 written into `raptor-port/docs/data-model.md` (Person, LeavePersonProfile, §5). The rest of the plan's §4 document
  fixes land WITH the build (D201), not yet.
- **Unfinished:** the whole build — phases 0 → 5 and 5b first (the shape IT needs), then 6 (worked out on read — its
  final hand-over waits on IT's written answer on reporting, §12 q9), then 7 (the small OIL follow-ups). Tier FULL; the
  walk before BOTH reviewers' code reads (D11, D353).
- **Branch:** `claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6`; no PR. Build on it.
- **Gates:** not run — documents only; nothing under `raptor-port/src` changed.
- **Open questions for him:** none of this chat's. For IT (his, `[IT-QUESTIONS]`): "no plug-in" in writing, and whether
  Custom APIs / Power Automate flows are allowed; can reports combine a day with the leave and people tables; when do
  their tables settle.
- **Parallel (D302):** rulings D460–D469 (D460–D463 used); observations #380–#389 (#380 used). No other open chat was
  changing this code on 30 Sep 26 — check `ListAgents` before building.
- **Pick up here:** read the plan whole (§8 included), open the area rulings files it touches (`scheduler.md`,
  `leave-war.md`, `tracker.md`, `people-accounts.md`, `oil.md`), then build phase 0 on this branch — red tests first.

## Next, in order

0. **THE DATABASE STEP STARTS NOW (D354, 29 Sep 26)** — `[IT-FLOW-GUIDE]` DONE (the guide for IT, `raptor-port/docs/it-flow-guide/`, 29 Sep 26); `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design DONE and merged (PR #475); `[DB-READINESS]` group A PLANNED 30 Sep 26 (plan v4,
   `claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6`) — its build next (D453). The IT team is taking the app into Dataverse now, and he means to
   keep working on the app beside it. What to finish before the hand-over was put to him the same day; record his answer
   here and in `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list the moment he gives it. Everything below keeps its ORDER; its timing is overtaken.
1. **HIS ORDER to the database step (D203, 26 Sep 26 — its timing overtaken by D354):** `[ACCOUNTS]`, `[ACCOUNTS-NEW-PERSON]`,
   `[POST-OUT-OUTCOMES]`, `[LW-MOVE-STANDARD]` (D264–D266) and `[ONE-DOOR]` (D309, D310, with `[POST-IN-DATE]`) MERGED
   (PRs #442, #443, #446, #447, #450) → **the one changes window (`[DRAFT-PENDING]`)** MERGED (PR #451, 28 Sep 26); its
   two follow-ups `[HIST-PHONE-HIDE]` and `[CHG-BY-ITEM]` (D345, D346) MERGED (PR #455, 28 Sep 26); beside it, he talks to the IT side
   (`[IT-QUESTIONS]`). Development as normal: `[HUMAN-RETEST]`'s remaining three in his order (D147 — the absence record
   with `[S4-HUNT-REST]` and D260–D262 MERGED, PR #444 — then change-recording, the Leave War links last), then `[LW-LOCKMARK]` → `[LW-WEEKDAY-WORK]` (`[PUB-UNAVAIL]`
   closed by the absence-record re-test).
2. **HIS ORDER NOW (D453, 29 Sep 26):** `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design fixed with the red team's findings → `[DB-READINESS]`
   **group A** (what decides the tables' shape — saving in small pieces, the schedule a day per piece, the change log, no
   week-deleting reconcile, the planning calendar's own records, no demo seed; with the small OIL follow-ups, D147) BEFORE
   IT settles its tables → the app connected (`[DB-STEP]`) → **group B** (tuned against the real database) → the lock's
   screens. Ask IT when its tables settle. The whole list: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
3. Filed, none blocking: `[TRK-PINCH-ASK]` (his iPhone look), `[LW-FROZEN-BAR-GAP]`; the Tracker leftovers'
   own residue — `[SAVE-NOTE-COVERS]` (medium, next), `[TRK-REMOUNT-LANDING]`, `[TRK-ASYNC-STALE]` (with `[DB-READINESS]`). Everything else: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
4. **Before ANY collaborator:** take the checks runner off this repo (Astra SEC-101, `[REPO-PRIVATE]`).

## Gate baseline

The latest counts watched — 29 Sep 26, `claude/lw-drag-flaky-tests-batch-c0719b`, one run under the PC lock: unit
**7017 / 7017** (434 files) · build clean · tfin **728 / 0** · e2e **509 passed, 0 failed**, 49 skipped (the month-window test,
once flaky, fixed — `[LW-WINDOW-PRUNE-FLAKE]`) · smoke **445 / 0** · rulecheck OK · docsize OK. Restate a count only from a run you watched, and REPLACE the previous counts — never stack a
history. How to run them: `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Build & verify; how they mislead, and the checks on his PC:
`raptor-port/docs/gates-and-deploy.md`.

## Standing constraints

Every one of these is the same missing piece — the server / sync backend —
wearing a different hat.

- **No shared data.** localStorage only; two devices never see each other's
  edits. Needs a server or sync backend; touches the storage seam (`raptor-port/src/storage/`,
  `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live) and the mutation funnel. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: it used to name
  `engine/hooks.ts:storeBackend`, which the storage seam replaced for everything but the `sqn142_*` settings.)*
- **Prototype auth.** *(Rewritten 26 Sep 26 by `[ACCOUNTS]`, on its branch.)* Accounts — one per person, tied to a
  callsign, managed on Admin → Users; the sign-in stands for the defence mail's and the app keeps no password; people on
  no list ask for access (D166, D204). Like all data, they live in one browser until the database, and the sign-in is no
  security (the app sits behind his Vercel sign-in — Vercel's lock, not the app's). A member is NOT view-only: they
  add, edit and delete their own Inputs and edit their own Quals row (D149).
  Roles table `docs/engine-rules.md` §Auth / roles; ONE permissions module (`raptor-port/src/state/perms.ts`,
  mirroring `data-model.md` §11, drift-tested); enforcement at the page, the write path and the command gate.
- **One dataset.** The schedule is the demo week (Mon 13 – Sun 19 Jul 26; the
  weekend is non-flying, duty crew only). Week chips re-label but every week
  shows the same data. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: a second demo week is authored from Mon 20 Jul —
  `raptor-port/src/engine/week2.ts` — and a week once edited keeps its own copy, persisted; an untouched week
  still falls back to the seed.)*
- **What survives a reload** — nearly everything, on a built site (the 19 Aug "session-only" rule was superseded 17 Sep 26 and its text archived in `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-2026-09-24.md`): the authoritative table is `raptor-port/docs/data-schema.md`; the short form is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §WHAT ACTUALLY PERSISTS.

## Where to look

The map of every document is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live (it loads with any file under
`raptor-port/`). From the root: the backlog `OUTSTANDING.md`, the rulings map `DECISIONS.md`, and — loaded in every
chat — `.claude/rules/shipping.md` (how a change ships) and `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md` (where each fact goes).
