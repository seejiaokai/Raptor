# HANDOFF — where things stand, and what is next

**A new chat reads this first.** It is the ONE handoff (D140, 24 Sep 26): `## Now` holds one block per open chat's
branch — where it stands, what it left, what to do next — and `## Next, in order` is the project's order; below
them, the standing facts. It holds CURRENT state only: a finished story is in git and, when a whole section left,
in `raptor-port/docs/archive/` (the 4 Sep 26 snapshot of this file is `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`, frozen); open work is
in `OUTSTANDING.md`; where each kind of fact goes is `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md`, loaded in every chat.

**Before acting on a block:** `git fetch`, then check the branch and PR it names — it describes the world when it
was written. Never push while a PR's checks are running (`gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1`; D151).
**Writing a block** (the session-handoff skill does it, at every handoff): rewrite ONLY your own block, between its
markers, even when nothing is pending; newest block first; remove another chat's block only after `git fetch` shows
its work merged and its open residue is filed in `OUTSTANDING.md`. Two parallel chats each keep their own block, and
the later merge keeps both (D78).

## Now

<!-- now:claude/insights-which-copy -->
### `claude/insights-which-copy` — `[INSIGHTS-WHICH-COPY]` (D477, D478): MERGED on his "merge live" (PR #479, 1 Oct 26); next: `[WORKSPAN-NEGATIVE]` in a fresh chat (D483) — written 1 Oct 26 — verify before use
- **Done:** the Insights window counts each day's latest published version, the working copy only for a day not yet
  published, on every page; WALK-checked (Astra's 19 scenarios by an Opus walker and the trial's Sonnet walker; Astra's final
  read, one finding fixed and re-walked). Evidence: `raptor-port/docs/handpass/2026-10-01-insights-which-copy-check.md`.
  He said "merge live" on 1 Oct 26 — check `gh pr view 479` shows MERGED and the live app is READY before anything else;
  then `[INSIGHTS-WHICH-COPY]` leaves `OUTSTANDING.md` by the script (homes: `raptor-port/docs/ui-contracts.md` §Week
  Insights and the evidence sheet) and this block is removed.
- **His four answers, recorded (1 Oct 26):** **D480** — one more Sonnet-walker trial, on a build with known defects; **D481** —
  the Scheduler Board gets an Insights button (proposed: beside the bell on a desktop, inside the ⋯ menu on a phone — a
  picture to him first); **D482** — a rule changed on the Logic page moves Insights' work hours at once, as built; **D483** —
  the negative work-hours fault is fixed in the next chat.
- **THE NEXT CHAT (D483):** `[WORKSPAN-NEGATIVE]` — a new worktree on `main`, its own branch, a FULL check (it changes the
  measure the long-work-day warning shares). **The second Sonnet trial (D480) rides on its walk:** freeze the build as it
  stands BEFORE the fix for the two trial walkers (one Opus, one Sonnet, the same brief, neither told what is wrong), and
  report what each caught. After it: `[INSIGHTS-BOARD-DOOR]` (D481), a picture first.
- **The main checkout** (`C:/Users/User/projects/Raptor`) was on this branch, not a worktree — it is put back on `main`
  after the merge; check `git -C C:/Users/User/projects/Raptor branch --show-current`.
- **Traps met:** the app allows five preview servers per folder and earlier chats' walk servers were still up (ports 4201–4203,
  4212, 4213) — walkers can share one server, each browser context being its own world (observation 417).
- **Parallel (D302):** rulings D480–D483 used here — a next chat takes D484 on; observations #417–#418 used, #419 on. No
  other open branch known when written.

## Next, in order

0. **THE DATABASE COMES AT THE END (D473, 1 Oct 26 — replaces D354's "starts now"):** the app's features are built first; after
   phase 7 no more database-readiness work until then; the table list (`raptor-port/docs/data-model.md`) is kept up to date as
   each feature is added, and he — with his AI — writes the table format for the IT side to enter. `[WARN-HIDE-KEPT]` is BUILT, FULL-checked and MERGED (1 Oct 26, PR #478); `[INSIGHTS-WHICH-COPY]` (D477, D478) BUILT, WALK-checked and MERGED on his "merge live" (1 Oct 26, PR #479). **Next (D483): `[WORKSPAN-NEGATIVE]`** — the negative work-hours fault, in a fresh chat, with the second Sonnet-walker trial on its walk (D480); then `[INSIGHTS-BOARD-DOOR]` (D481).
   *Done while the step was "starting now" (29 Sep – 1 Oct 26):* `[IT-FLOW-GUIDE]` DONE (the guide for IT, `raptor-port/docs/it-flow-guide/`, 29 Sep 26); `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design DONE and merged (PR #475); `[DB-READINESS]` group A PLANNED 30 Sep 26 (plan v4,
   `claude/db-readiness-table-shaping-4094f6`) — its build under way: phases 0–5 and 5b built 30 Sep 26, the group's FULL check done (the walk and both code reads, every finding fixed); phase 6 (a), (b), (d) built and FULL-checked 30 Sep 26 (`raptor-port/docs/handpass/2026-09-30-dbr-phase6-check.md`); phase 6 (c) v3 built and FULL-checked 1 Oct 26 on `claude/db-readiness-p6c-holder-base` (D467 — `…/2026-10-01-dbr-phase6c-check.md`) — phases 0–6 MERGED 1 Oct 26 on his "merge live" (PR #476); phase 7, the small OIL follow-ups, BUILT and FULL-checked 1 Oct 26 (`…/2026-10-01-dbr-phase7-check.md`) and MERGED the same day on his "merge live" (PR #477) — group A is closed (D453); `[WARN-HIDE-KEPT]` (D469, D471, D472, D475) BUILT, FULL-checked and MERGED 1 Oct 26 (PR #478). The IT team is taking the app into Dataverse now, and he means to
   keep working on the app beside it. What to finish before the hand-over was put to him the same day; record his answer
   here and in `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list the moment he gives it. Everything below keeps its ORDER; its timing is overtaken — *and that hand-over now waits for the end (D473).*
1. **HIS ORDER to the database step (D203, 26 Sep 26 — its timing overtaken by D354):** `[ACCOUNTS]`, `[ACCOUNTS-NEW-PERSON]`,
   `[POST-OUT-OUTCOMES]`, `[LW-MOVE-STANDARD]` (D264–D266) and `[ONE-DOOR]` (D309, D310, with `[POST-IN-DATE]`) MERGED
   (PRs #442, #443, #446, #447, #450) → **the one changes window (`[DRAFT-PENDING]`)** MERGED (PR #451, 28 Sep 26); its
   two follow-ups `[HIST-PHONE-HIDE]` and `[CHG-BY-ITEM]` (D345, D346) MERGED (PR #455, 28 Sep 26); beside it, he talks to the IT side
   (`[IT-QUESTIONS]`). Development as normal: `[HUMAN-RETEST]`'s remaining three in his order (D147 — the absence record
   with `[S4-HUNT-REST]` and D260–D262 MERGED, PR #444 — then change-recording, the Leave War links last), then `[LW-LOCKMARK]` → `[LW-WEEKDAY-WORK]` (`[PUB-UNAVAIL]`
   closed by the absence-record re-test).
2. **HIS ORDER NOW (D453, 29 Sep 26):** `[DB-SYNC-MODEL]`'s design fixed with the red team's findings → `[DB-READINESS]`
   **group A** (what decides the tables' shape — saving in small pieces, the schedule a day per piece, the change log, no
   week-deleting reconcile, the planning calendar's own records, no demo seed; with the small OIL follow-ups, D147) BEFORE
   IT settles its tables → the app connected (`[DB-STEP]`) → **group B** (tuned against the real database) → the lock's
   screens. *(D473, 1 Oct 26: group A is built; the connection, group B and the lock's screens wait for the end — there is no
   "before its tables settle" to race now.)* The whole list: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
3. Filed, none blocking: `[TRK-PINCH-ASK]` (his iPhone look), `[LW-FROZEN-BAR-GAP]`; the Tracker leftovers'
   own residue — `[SAVE-NOTE-COVERS]` (medium, next), `[TRK-REMOUNT-LANDING]`, `[TRK-ASYNC-STALE]` (with `[DB-READINESS]`). Everything else: `OUTSTANDING.md`'s priority list.
4. **Before ANY collaborator:** take the checks runner off this repo (Astra SEC-101, `[REPO-PRIVATE]`).

## Gate baseline

The latest counts watched — 1 Oct 26, `claude/insights-which-copy` (`[INSIGHTS-WHICH-COPY]` with the fix of its final read; merged
the same day, PR #479), under the PC lock: unit **7560 / 7560** (474 files) · build clean · tfin **728 / 0** · e2e **518 passed,
0 failed**, 49 skipped · smoke **445 / 0** · rulecheck OK (notes `AM39d` now covered — older, left) · docsize OK (OVER, deferred
— D29) · perf not run on this branch (last watched on `claude/warn-hide-kept`: **4 / 0**, board DOM 1024 ≤ 1150, week 5134 ≤ 5450). Restate a count only from a run you watched, and REPLACE the previous counts — never stack a
history. How to run them: `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Build & verify; how they mislead, and the checks on his PC:
`raptor-port/docs/gates-and-deploy.md`.

## Standing constraints

Every one of these is the same missing piece — the server / sync backend —
wearing a different hat.

- **No shared data.** localStorage only; two devices never see each other's
  edits. Needs a server or sync backend; touches the storage seam (`raptor-port/src/storage/`,
  `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live) and the mutation funnel. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: it used to name
  `engine/hooks.ts:storeBackend`, which the storage seam replaced for everything but the `sqn142_*` settings.)*
- **Prototype auth.** *(Rewritten 26 Sep 26 by `[ACCOUNTS]`, on its branch.)* Accounts — one per person, tied to a
  callsign, managed on Admin → Users; the sign-in stands for the defence mail's and the app keeps no password; people on
  no list ask for access (D166, D204). Like all data, they live in one browser until the database, and the sign-in is no
  security (the app sits behind his Vercel sign-in — Vercel's lock, not the app's). A member is NOT view-only: they
  add, edit and delete their own Inputs and edit their own Quals row (D149).
  Roles table `docs/engine-rules.md` §Auth / roles; ONE permissions module (`raptor-port/src/state/perms.ts`,
  mirroring `data-model.md` §11, drift-tested); enforcement at the page, the write path and the command gate.
- **One dataset.** The schedule is the demo week (Mon 13 – Sun 19 Jul 26; the
  weekend is non-flying, duty crew only). Week chips re-label but every week
  shows the same data. *(Corrected 24 Sep 26: a second demo week is authored from Mon 20 Jul —
  `raptor-port/src/engine/week2.ts` — and a week once edited keeps its own copy, persisted; an untouched week
  still falls back to the seed.)*
- **What survives a reload** — nearly everything, on a built site (the 19 Aug "session-only" rule was superseded 17 Sep 26 and its text archived in `raptor-port/docs/archive/handoff-2026-09-24.md`): the authoritative table is `raptor-port/docs/data-schema.md`; the short form is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §WHAT ACTUALLY PERSISTS.

## Where to look

The map of every document is `raptor-port/CLAUDE.md` §Where things live (it loads with any file under
`raptor-port/`). From the root: the backlog `OUTSTANDING.md`, the rulings map `DECISIONS.md`, and — loaded in every
chat — `.claude/rules/shipping.md` (how a change ships) and `.claude/rules/doc-structure.md` (where each fact goes).
